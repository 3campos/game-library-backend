Meeting with Phil:
process.env variable is used to store the frontend url or backend url which you’re then using in the backend.

Backend establishment is done in server.js

In the frontend, what allows you to connect to the backend would be the fetches. The fetches are using the variables used in the backend url. It’s fetching from the variables.

All of that logic in the frontend function is what’s getting data or sending data to the backend.
Then, in the backend, in the server you’re setting up the whitelist for cors in server.js in the backend.

frontend is making fetch requests
work on frontend fetches: get post, put, delete in the frontend
